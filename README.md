# Logo Generator

The purpose of this application is to generate a high-quality logo, using Node.js via the command line, that can be used by potential users and clients.

## Description

Using the command line, users enter responses/information based on four questions. These questions inquire what text they would like on their logo (with a maximum of 3 characters), which color they would like the text to be, which shape (cirlce, triangle, or square) they would like their logo to be, and which color they would like the shape to be. 
Upon entering their responses to the questions, a logo is generated and saved as an SVG file. 

Additionally, I used Jest to run tests on the Circle, Triangle, and Square child classes of the Shape parent class to ensure that the code is functioning properly.
